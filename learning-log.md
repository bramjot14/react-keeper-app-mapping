# Learning Log – React Keeper App (Part 2)

### What I Learned
- Used `Array.map()` to dynamically render multiple React components
- Passed props (`title`, `content`) from data to components
- Used `key` prop correctly for list rendering
- Separated data logic (`notes.js`) from UI components
- Improved component reusability and clean structure

### Key Concepts Practiced
- JSX expressions inside `{ }`
- Functional components
- Props flow from parent to child
- Rendering lists in React
- Clean folder and component organization

### Outcome
Built a scalable notes UI where components render dynamically from data instead of being hardcoded.
